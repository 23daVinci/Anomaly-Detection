üß± Phase 1: Fundamentals of Anomaly Detection
1. Understanding Anomaly Detection
Types of anomalies: point, contextual, collective

Supervised vs. unsupervised vs. semi-supervised anomaly detection

Common use cases and challenges (e.g., imbalanced data)

2. Probability & Statistics Refresher
Descriptive statistics: mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis

Probability distributions: Gaussian, Poisson, Exponential, etc.

Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals

Central Limit Theorem
